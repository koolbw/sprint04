# Overview

Something that I really enjoy doing is cooking so I thought of making a simple program to be able to store recipes on a database in this case it was a firstore database. 

When you run the program it will give you the options to view the recipes in the database, add a recipe or remove a recipe from the database. I left the program pretty simple on purpose to be able to add more to it in the future, such as more options to add information or more functionality. 

Maybe this could be integrated with a mobile app to be able to access your recipes from your phone or computer.

# Cloud Database

I am using a firestore database because it was free and pretty simple to set up and integrate with python. 

The database is set up very simply and only has two collections right now, one for the recipes and the other for any logs (information about adding or removing recipes with timestamps).

# Development Environment

While working on this project I used the following: 

* VS Code
* Python 3.10
* Firstore Database

# Useful Websites

* [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/build)
* [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

# Future Work

Some of the things I would do in the future if I had time to expand on this code:

* Add more functionality to the code (More options on what to do with the recipes).
* Add more information to each recipe, maybe better formating.
* I would probably try to integrate it with a mobile app, probably using Android Studio.
